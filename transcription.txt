This is my tomato, mozzarella and basil stuffed flatbread and you only need two ingredients to make them. Start by adding flour and Greek yogurt to a bowl and gradually using a wooden spoon form a ball on the dough. Knead it for about five minutes until it's nice and smooth. Then we're gonna cut it into eight pieces and we're gonna chop some sun-dried tomatoes, basil, feta, mozzarella, cream cheese and give it a mix. Then we're gonna add it to our dough after we flattened it out like this and we're going to pinch the ends and bring them all up to the middle and pinch the middle like this. Then we're gonna cook them low and slow for about two or three minutes on each side until they're nice and golden brown. There ain't nothing bad about this.
